            <h2>reinventing the F word: FEMINISM</h2>
            <div class="streets"></div>
            <arcticle class="text">
                <p>The Guerrilla Girls are feminist activist artists. We wear gorilla masks in public and use facts, humor and outrageous visuals to expose gender and ethnic bias as well as corruption in politics, art, film, and pop culture. Our anonymity keeps the focus on the issues, and away from who we might be: we could be anyone and we are everywhere. We believe in an intersectional feminism that fights discrimination and supports human rights for all people and all genders. We undermine the idea of a mainstream narrative by revealing the understory, the subtext, the overlooked, and the downright unfair. 
                    
                <p>Recently we produced new street and museum projects at Tate Modern and Whitechapel Gallery, London; São Paulo Museum of Art; Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam; Museum of Military History, Dresden; Art Basel Hong Kong; and many other places.</p>
                    
                <p>What’s next? More creative complaining! More interventions! More resistance!</p>
